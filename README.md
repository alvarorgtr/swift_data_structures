# swift_data_structures

The purpose of this project is to implement a series of well-known data structures in the swift programming language. Although this structures may be useful, the main focus of this project will be on learning about both the swift programming language and the inner workings of data structures.

Basic list of structures to be implemented:
- Linear data structures:
  - Singly linked list
  - Doubly linked list
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - Deque (double ended queue)
- Trees:
  - Binary search tree
  - Tree map
    - AVL tree map
    - Left-leaning red-black tree map
